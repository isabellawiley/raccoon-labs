            The Surf & Destroy was born from a misunderstanding. When I first started recording with my cassette four track many moons ago, I didn’t realize it had a preamp built in (who reads manuals?). My only mic was an SM57, so to get the volume up I would run the mic through a light overdrive pedal before going into the four track. It was wrong, but I loved how it sounded. Especially how it gave my amp reverb just a little bit of dirt and ‘tude, if you know what I mean -and I think you do. The Surf and Destroy is my take on that sound in a pedal. It feeds a nice spring-ish reverb into a versatile gain circuit.

                Here are some things you can do:

                - Overdrive your reverb, from just a little touch sensitive crisp to full on blown out gnarly mayhem

                - Turn off the overdrive, and just use the reverb totally clean

                - Turn down the reverb until it’s just dry signal, and then use the overdrive/fuzz on it’s own

                - Run vocals through it, live your lofi dream

                - Crank the gain and reverb shoegaze with it (yeah buddy)
