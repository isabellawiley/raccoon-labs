            <p>Raccoon Labs pedals are birthed into this world one at a time in swamp-ridden Houston, TX. They come with a lifetime warranty for manufacturer defect (my life, I’m fairly healthy). Please note that since I screen print each pedal by hand, there will be slight variations in the artwork. Rejoice in your uniqueness. Sometimes I do different color schemes, but I’ll always post a photo if they’re that different!</p>

            <p>All Raccoon Labs creatures require a healthy diet of 9V energy (no more, they will hurt!) fed through a center negative “boss style” adapter.</p>
